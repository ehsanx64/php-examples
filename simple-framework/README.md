# simple-framework

This is a dummy framework I started writing and playing with a long time age. It's a mess, incomplete and newbie-level; but I've decided to push it to GitHub, clean it up a little and keep it for historical purpose.

Don't even think about using it for serious purposes. You've been warned.

## How to run

First do a `composer install` and then:

```bash
composer run-script serve
```
